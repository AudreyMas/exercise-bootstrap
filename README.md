OBJECTIVE D: short rapport of usability issues

According to the goal(s) use(s) of this card, we can test/improve the usability by : 

- Checking if the 10 Usability principles Heuristics of Nielsen are respected.
Here, I could improve for exemple :
* the consistency and standards in the design to the different tab
* status of the loading tab by indicate if something will be display or not

- Setting up some methods like Heat maps or Eye Tracking,... could be use to see if the main actions are correctly done by user.

- Testing the platform on different browser

- Improving the responsive nav
